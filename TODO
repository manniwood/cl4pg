Clean up the test cases so that things that happen over and over
are not repeated.

4.5) Add tests to show how to capture exception text and act upon it
as with foreign key constraint violations, etc.

2) Write better comments in files

1) This creates a lot of command beans; explicitly set them to null when done with them, as hint to gc
Or, should each instance of a PGSession instantiate an instance of each command for re-use? Or, is that overengineering?

6) row listener that can be fed to select methods
8) selectReport that returns map of string:colname string:value
for use in quick reporting displays where all values
would end up being cast to string anyway.
8) selectMap that returns map of String:colname Object:value
for when a user just needs a quick way of getting the objects
out of a query, and doesn't mind doing the casting himself.
4) More type converters
7) find and document that JVM setting that makes java turn
reflection calls into compiled code faster (instead of waiting
for the default number of invocations).
10) sql to be executed on startup of connection
11) make psql exception more easily available in exceptions thrown
12) Converters registerable and addable by end-users
13) Better conf capabilities
